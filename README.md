## ❓ Why This Exists

I'm a film producer. I live in my calendar, planning shoots months ahead. Weather determines everything - can we shoot outside? Do we need rain gear? Should we reschedule?

I got tired of switching between calendar and weather apps. Apple Calendar only shows weather if you add a location to each event. Google Calendar killed their weather feature. Other services are broken or want $5/month for something that should be free.

I just wanted to glance at next Tuesday and see if it's going to rain. So I built this.
